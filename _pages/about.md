This is the front page of my academic website. My name is **Lin Xingjiang (Bryce)**, and I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at the **University at Buffalo**. My primary research interests include **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **multimodal reasoning**, **natural language processing**, and **building scalable AI systems**.

I am actively seeking **Research Assistant (RA) opportunities**, **PhD programs**, and **internships** to deepen my experience and contribute to impactful research in these exciting fields. My ultimate goal is to create intelligent systems that can seamlessly understand, reason, and interact with the world in multimodal and agent-based environments.

This website is built using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. You can explore my **research**, **projects**, **publications**, and **presentations** through the navigation bar. I also maintain a **blog** where I share insights and document my journey in the AI research landscape.

A data-driven personal website
======
The website separates content from form using structured markdown files and YAML metadata, allowing for easy updates and customization. My site content, including **projects**, **talks**, **teaching materials**, and **CV**, is stored in markdown files and automatically rendered as static HTML pages. This approach ensures efficient resource usage and easy version control.

I believe in the power of **open collaboration** and **sharing knowledge**, so feel free to explore, reach out, or connect if you’re interested in collaborating or discussing potential opportunities.
